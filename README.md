# 📊 iPhone 14 vs iPhone 15 Sales Comparison Analysis

🚀 **Project Objective**  
The goal of this project is to conduct a comparative analysis of iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 sales data using Power BI. The objective is to understand how the new iPhone model performed globally, calculate the variance in sales, and generate a business-ready report for insight-driven decision-making.

## 📁 Datasets Used

- `fact_sales_Iphone14.csv` 📱
- `fact_sales_Iphone15.csv` 📱
- `dim_stores.csv` 🏬

These datasets include transactional data of iPhone sales by store and their mapping to countries.

## 📌 What I Did

✅ Imported datasets into **Power BI**  
✅ Joined `fact_sales` with `dim_stores` to map each sale to a country  
✅ Aggregated total iPhone 14 and 15 sales by country  
✅ Calculated:
- **Absolute Sales Variance**  
  `= ABS(iPhone 15 Sales - iPhone 14 Sales)`
- **Percentage Sales Variance**  
  `= ((iPhone 15 Sales - iPhone 14 Sales) / iPhone 14 Sales) * 100`

✅ Created an interactive Power BI table to showcase:
- iPhone 14 Sales 📦  
- iPhone 15 Sales 📦  
- Sales Variance in Units 📉  
- Sales Variance in % 📉

✅ Highlighted the **Top 10 countries** and provided a **total summary**

**🧾 Summary of Results:**
- Total iPhone 14 Sales: **1,232,065**
- Total iPhone 15 Sales: **1,179,524**
